\title{Function to start some number of vessels in a number of clusters
Stop at each time step and allow vessels to share recent catch information}
\usage{
fleet_trip(input = filt_clusts, ntows = 20, clusts = c(295, 58, 265),
  seed = 300, scope = 1, quotas, scale = "fleet",
  the_port = "ASTORIA / WARRENTON", catch_type = "type_clust_perc",
  prof_type = "avg_profit_fuel_only", objective, risk_pool)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Input; default to filt_clusts}

\item{ntows}{Number of tows}

\item{clusts}{Starting clusters; equal to the number of vessels}

\item{seed}{Seed to get reproducible results}

\item{scope}{Scope of movement}

\item{quotas}{Quotas; can be a list for each vessel or a single data frame if risk pool}

\item{scale}{If scale == "fleet"; can only look at clusters that others are fishing in}

\item{risk_pool}{If TRUE, quotas can only be a data frame and everything held to the same standard}

\item{prob_type}{Type of probability to use; type_clust_perc (proportion of tows with species group)
or type_clust_catch (proportion of catches)}
}
